        <p><strong>1. 
Mix all the dry ingredients together - whole wheat flour, all purpose flour and salt.<br>
2. Add olive oil and with your fingers mix the oil in the flour evenly to get a breadcrumb consistency. It gives a flaky texture to the crust. the whole mixture should look like breadcrumbs.<br>
3. Add water and just bind the whole mixture together. form a dough but don't knead.<br>
4. Peel, core and slice the apples. Mix the cinnamon powder, sugar and whole wheat flour into the apples. 
5. Preheat your oven. Grease your pie pan or pans with olive oil. Divide the dough into two or four equal parts depending on the size of your pie pans.<br>
6. Roll the divided parts of the dough on a dusted work surface. Cover the rolled pie crusts with a napkin so that they don't dry out. Place one of the rolled pie crust gently on a greased pan and press it towards the bottom and the edges.<br>
7. Arrange the apple slices with the filling evenly on the bottom pie crust. Top the apple slices with dots of butter or a few drops of olive oil. <br>
8. Cover the pan with another rolled pie crust and fold the edges of the top crust over and under the bottom edges. Flute the edges. You can also cut strips from the rolled dough and create a lattice pie crust. </strong>

    <h3 class= "steps">Steps</h3>
        <p><strong>1. 
Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 12 cup muffin tin or line with paper liners and set aside.<br>
2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.<br>
3. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat butter on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Scraping the bowl as needed.<br>      4. Gradually add the sugar and beat until well combined. Reduce the mixer to low and add the egg, egg whites, and vanilla extract.<br>
5. With the mixer on low, add half the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Add the milk, mixing until just combined. Add the remaining flour and mix until just combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold in the chopped strawberries.<br>
6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean. Transfer the muffin tin to a wire rack to cool completely before icing.<br>

7. If using freeze dried strawberries: 
In a small food processor, blend about 1/2 cup freeze dried strawberries until they turn into powder. Pour the powder into a fine mesh sieve, discarding the solids and seeds, keeping the fine powder that came through the sieve. Measure out two tablespoons of the powder to use in the frosting. Proceed below. <br>
8. With a hand mixer, or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter for 2 minutes, until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the beater as necessary. Add the powdered sugar, 1/2 a cup at a time, beating until combined. <br>
9. Add strawberry puree, freeze dried strawberry powder (if using), vanilla extract and jam, and beat on medium speed until fully combined, being sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl and beater as needed. If necessary, adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar or more strawberry puree, to thicken or thin it out. Place in a piping bag, or use an offset spatula to frost cupcakes (this makes enough frosting to generously frost the cupcakes). Garnish with sliced strawberries, if desired </strong>
